NewsDe-Lite

# Logic behind the name of project
News obviously stands for delivering news and current events.

De-Lite sounds like “delight,” which means pleasure or joy.

So, NewsDe-Lite means news that delights you — delivering news in a way that’s enjoyable, light, and easy to consume.

It suggests your site brings fresh, interesting, and user-friendly news content that makes readers feel good rather than overwhelmed.

# News + Delight = NewsDe-Lite = News that delights you!

# About Project
